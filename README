This is the README for colourchange.sty.

Do not use a theme with this package. It will break things.

Add the package to your preamble, and avoid other styling/theme/colour commands unless you know what you're doing.
You need to compile twice for it to work.

The command \selectcolourchanges{first}{second} takes two arguments: the starting colour and the final colour of the presentation.
These should be colours already understood by beamer.
