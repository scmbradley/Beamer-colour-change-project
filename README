This is the README for colourchange.sty.

Don't use a colour theme or full theme (which sometimes call colour themes).
You should be OK calling inner themes and outer themes separately (although some look better than others at the moment: see bottom of readme).
You need to compile twice for it to work.

Requires packages etoolbox and calc.
Also needs some other stuff that is loaded by beamer.
Use with other classes at your own risk.

%------------------------------
% Summary of commands
%------------------------------

\selectcolourchanges{first}{second} takes two arguments: the starting colour and the final colour of the presentation.
These should be colours already understood by beamer.
Beamer uses xcolor, so you can define colours with xcolor commands and then use them in \selectcolourchanges.
That's what I do for the defaults.

%------------------------------
% Summary of options
%------------------------------

defaultstyle
Turns on default inner and outerthemes.
Or rather, it will do soo.

draft
The draft option turns off colour changing.
Good for speeding up compilation when drafting.

slidechange
The default option: colour changes every slide.

framechange
Colour changes every frame.

To do list
----------
Make sure it works with all base inner/outer themes.
 - smoothbars, split, shadow, tree outer themes uses palette quaternary (b/w)
 - smoothtree doesn't seem to use structure colours at all.
