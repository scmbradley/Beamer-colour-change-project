This is the README for colourchange.sty.

Do not use a theme with this package. It will break things.

Add the package to your preamble, and avoid other styling/theme/colour commands unless you know what you're doing.
You need to compile twice for it to work.

The command \selectcolourchanges{first}{second} takes two arguments: the starting colour and the final colour of the presentation.
These should be colours already understood by beamer.

There is a draft option. 
Pass this to the package or to the document class, if you want to to do other magic elsewhere with beamer.
There is also a final option, so you can have draft doing magic elsewhere but still have colourchanges.
Although, I've just noticed that the draft option passed to the document class changes quite a lot of stuff, so I expect the final option is fairly useless.
