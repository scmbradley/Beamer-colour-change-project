This is the README for colourchange.sty.

Do not use a theme with this package. It will break things. (Coming soon: not breaking with other themes)

Add the package to your preamble, and avoid other styling/theme/colour commands unless you know what you're doing.
You need to compile twice for it to work.

%------------------------------
% Summary of commands
%------------------------------

\selectcolourchanges{first}{second} takes two arguments: the starting colour and the final colour of the presentation.
These should be colours already understood by beamer.
Beamer uses xcolor, so you can define colours with xcolor commands and then use them in \selectcolourchanges.
That's what I do for the defaults.

%------------------------------
% Summary of options
%------------------------------

defaultstyle
Turns on default inner and outerthemes.
Or rather, it will do soo.

draft
The draft option turns off colour changing.
Good for speeding up compilation when drafting.
